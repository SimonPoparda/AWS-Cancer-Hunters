# AWS-Cancer-Hunters
In this project I'm going to use AWS (Amazon S3, Amazon Athena etc.) in order to help doctors treat cancer. Objectives for this project are provided by AWS Educate.

## Objectives

- Explore multiple cancer cell sample data sets using Athena SQL.
- Identify cancerous cell mutations from normal cell sequences.
- Investigate the errors in DNA sequences from retrieved genomic data.
- Discuss the potential targeted cancer treatment based on clinical DNA mutation data.


## Setting up an environment
Firstly, I opened AWS Console Home and searched for Athena

And created an instance

## Scenarios
I was presented with 4 scenarios from 4 different doctors

- SCENARIO 1: DR. WEI AND TP53 MUTATION:
"A researcher, Dr. Wei, is curious about the distribution of different cancers among women in his oncology practice. In particular, Dr. Wei is wondering if any of these cancers are TP53 mutations.

Use the subset of your datasets to help Dr. Wei determine what type of cancer in females is caused by the TP53 mutation."
